# Neural Field Navigational Model

Google colab file to model leech navigation from mechanical water waves using neural fields. Written for the Quanitative Biology and Engineering Sciences lab at UNC Chapel Hill.

Leeches use different sensory modalities to navigate through their environment and perform behaviors such as scavenge for food or escape from predators. One of their primary sources of environmental information comes from the water wave disturbances. These water waves are defined by various physical properties such as frequency, wavelength, density, and depth. Previous studies show that leeches prefer specific frequencies of water waves, although is this study we take a different approach and predict that leech's are responding preferentially wavelength. The wavelength of these waves depend on the frequency and water depth. In this study, we look at how changes in water depth affect the leech's neural behavior and navigational behavior by employing a neural field for neural processing and an agent-based model to simulate leech movement.
